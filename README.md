# Cat vs Dog Classification using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, and the web interface for uploading and classifying images is built with Streamlit.

## Features

- Image preprocessing and data augmentation
- CNN model for binary classification (cat vs dog)
- Streamlit app for image upload and classification
- Deployment-ready with `requirements.txt`

## Setup Instructions
